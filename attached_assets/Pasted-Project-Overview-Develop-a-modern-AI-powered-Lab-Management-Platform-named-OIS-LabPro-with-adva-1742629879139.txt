Project Overview:
Develop a modern, AI-powered Lab Management Platform named "OIS LabPro" with advanced features for seamless diagnostic test management, real-time tracking, and smart reporting. The system must prioritize user experience, security, and scalability to compete with leading healthcare SaaS solutions.

Core Features
User Panel

Intuitive dashboard for test booking, payment, and report access.

Real-time status updates with color-coded tracking (grey → blue → dark blue → yellow → green).

Test history, downloadable reports, and predictive health trends based on past results.

Mobile-responsive design with optional progressive web app (PWA) support.

Online Test Booking

Search/filter tests by category (e.g., CBC, CRP) or symptoms.

Home sample collection scheduling with GPS tracking for phlebotomists.

Automated reminders (SMS/email) for appointments and report deadlines.

Admin Panel

Manage bookings, sample collection teams, and lab technicians.

Custom header/footer upload for branded report templates.

Bulk report uploads and AI-driven anomaly detection in test data.

Super Admin Panel

Multi-lab management (add/remove labs, assign admins).

Global analytics dashboard with revenue, test volume, and regional trends.

Advanced Reporting Engine
Test-Specific PDF Generation

Dynamic templates auto-populated with formulas/results (e.g., CBC = WBC+RBC+Hemoglobin; CRP = mg/L thresholds).

AI-powered insights: Highlight abnormal values with contextual notes (e.g., "High platelet count: Consult a hematologist").

Download Without Login

Users retrieve reports via unique OIS-LAB-XXXXXX ID or mobile verification.

Auto-expire download links after 72 hours for security.

Innovative Additions to Compete in 2024
Smart Features

AI Chat Assistant: Answers user queries (e.g., "What does my CRP value mean?").

Predictive Alerts: Flag potential health risks (e.g., "Consistent high glucose → diabetes risk").

Integrations

EHR/EMR integration (e.g., Epic, Cerner).

Wearable sync (Fitbit/Apple Health) to correlate lab data with activity.

Security & Compliance

HIPAA/GDPR compliance, end-to-end encryption, and blockchain-based audit logs.

Facial recognition or OTP for sensitive report access.

Marketplace for Add-Ons

Let labs offer bundled tests (e.g., "Senior Citizen Package") or partner with wellness apps.

Modern UI/UX Requirements
Figma Design: Sleek, minimalist interface with:

Dark/light mode toggle.

Interactive status timeline (drag to see progress).

Data visualizations (e.g., trend graphs for repeat tests).

Micro-Animations: Smooth transitions for notifications and report generation.

Voice Search: "Book a cholesterol test for next Monday."

Goal: Position OIS LabPro as the all-in-one solution for labs to streamline operations, enhance patient trust, and boost revenue through tech-driven healthcare.
